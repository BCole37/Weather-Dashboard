# Weather Dashboard

## Project Detials
The goal of this project was getting used to making API calls before the project.


# Why
This allows access to many different things and the API's make site able to use data they don't have to host that is useful in this case a Weather Dashboard that one can look at.
Along witht aht this assignement renforces many things previously taught such as making an HTML site, editing HTMl with Java, and using localStorage.

# Problems Solved
Making the Site
-Has a searchBox that a city can be inputed into
-Once searched data for that city appears in its own section along with below that a 5 day forcast for the city appears
-The data shown is weather, temperature, UV index, and wind speed
-The data entered is saved locally which allows the user to click on a previous city without creating a new entery


# Takaways
It is cool that with just a call you vcan get access to another database that provides specific information.
The Api Keys I think I understand.
I need alot more practice adding to HTML with Java
